                    Our mission is to increase the visibility of Aotearoaâ€™s amazing women engineers, and connect with
                    our educators to access resources and speakers so that more young people can find their role models
                    and be inspired to find out more about a wide range of engineering careers. This database also gives
                    our women engineers a way to connect with each other while supporting the next generation of
                    engineers in New Zealand. Create. Connect. Inspire.
